This repository contains the Python version of the code associated with Alexander Norquist's *A Modern Twist on an 
Old Measurement: Using Laboratory Automation and Data Science to Determine the Solubility Product of Lead Iodide*
There will be a total of three notebooks that correspond to the three Mathematica notebooks that are featured in the 
paper. By having notebooks in both Python and Mathematica languages, the hope is to provide students with a more
encompassingn view of programming and data science in general as they pertain to chemistry.
